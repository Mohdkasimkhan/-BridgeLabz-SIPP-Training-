This summer, I enrolled in the Java Practice Summer Classes organized by Brizzlab â€” and it turned out to be one of the most enriching learning experiences for building a solid foundation in core Java.

ðŸ’» Key Highlights:
Hands-on coding sessions with real-time examples.

Concepts covered: OOPs, Strings, Arrays, Loops, Recursion, File Handling, Exception Handling, etc.

Daily practice questions to strengthen logic-building and syntax.

Built multiple mini-projects to apply the concepts in real-world problems.

Regular doubt-solving sessions and mentor guidance from industry-level trainers.

Practice for placement-level MCQs and coding challenges.
